# AdofaiTheater

A generator for low-effort Adofai Remake Theater and probably profit

## Notes

This project is a side project and is mainly created for me to play with SkiaSharp and graphic programming. If this project turns out to be pretty smooth, I might do several episode of such theater videos for easy dopamine and to maintain some adofai funny content.

This project is also my first attempt at using wsl nvim + visual studio hybrid development.

**Update:** The attempt failed. Visual studio is still very good though.
Now the project turned out to be a giant disaster of linear algebra and ffmpeg spaghetti.
